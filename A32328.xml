         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Am glad to ſee you here this day; I would have called you together ſooner, but that I was willing to Eaſe you and the Countrey, till there were an abſolute neceſsity.</p>
            <p>Since you were laſt here, I have been forced to a moſt important, neceſſary, and expenſive War, and I make no doubt, but you will give Me ſuitable and effectual Aſsiſtance to go through with it. I refer you to My Declaration for the Cauſes, and indeed the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this War; and ſhall now onely tell you, That I might have digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Indignities to My Own Perſon, rather then have brought it to this Extremity, if the Intereſt, as well as the Honour of the whole Kingdom had not been at ſtake: And if I had omitted this Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, perhaps I had not again ever met with the like Advantage.</p>
            <p>You will find that the laſt Supply you gave Me, did not anſwer Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation for the Ends you gave it, The payment of My Debts. Therefore I muſt in the next place recommend them again to your eſpecial Care.</p>
            <p>Some few dayes before I Declar'd the War, I put forth My Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for indulgence to Diſſenters, and have hitherto found a good Effect of it, by ſecuring Peace at Home, when I had War Abroad. There is one part in it that hath been ſubject to Miſconſtruction, which is that concerning the Papiſts; as if more Liberty were granted them, then to the other Recuſants; when it is plain there is leſs: For the Others have publick places allowed them, and I never intended that they ſhould have any, but only have the Freedom of their Religion in their own houſes, without any Concourſe of others. And I could not grant them leſs then this, when I had extended ſo much more Grace to others, moſt of them having been Loyal and in the Service of Me, and of the King my Father; And in the whole courſe of this Indulgence, I do not intend that it ſhall any way Prejudice the Church, but I will Support its Rights, and It in its full Power. Having ſaid this, I ſhall take it very ill to receive Contradiction in what I have done. And I will deal plainly with you, I am reſolved to ſtick to my Declaration.</p>
            <p>There is one Jealouſie more that is maliciouſly ſpread abroad, and yet ſo weak and frivolous, that I once thought it not of moment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to mention; but it may have gotten ſome ground with ſome well minded people, and that is, That the Forces I have raiſed in this War, were deſigned to Control Law and Property; I wiſh I had had more Forces the laſt Summer, the want of them then, convinces me I muſt raiſe more againſt this next Spring; And I do not doubt but you will Conſider the Charge of them in your Supplies.</p>
            <p>I will Conclude with this aſſurance to you, That I will preſerve the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion, and the Church as it is now Eſtabliſhed in this Kingdom, and that no mans Property or Liberty ſhall ever be invaded. <hi>I leave the reſt to the Chancellor.</hi>

               <salute>My Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſses of the Houſe of Commons,</salute>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He King hath ſpoken ſo fully, ſo excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well, and ſo like Himſelf, that you are not to expect much from me. There is not a word in His Speech that hath not its <hi>full weight:</hi> And, I dare with aſſurance ſay, will have its <hi>effect</hi> with you. His Majeſty had called you ſooner, and His Affairs required it, but that He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to give you all the eaſe, and vacancy to your own private Concerns; and the People as much reſpit from Payments and Taxes, as the neceſſity of His Buſineſs, or their Preſervation would permit. And yet (which I cannot but here mention to you) by the Crafty inſinuations of ſome ill-affected perſons, there have been ſpread ſtrange and deſperate <hi>rumours,</hi> which your Meeting together this day, hath ſufficiently proved both malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and falſe.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty hath told you, that He is now engaged in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, very expenſive, and indeed a <hi>War</hi> abſolutely neceſſary, and unavoidable. He hath referred you to His <hi>Declaration,</hi> where you will find the <hi>Perſonal indignities</hi> by <hi>Pictures,</hi> and <hi>Medals,</hi> and other <hi>publique affronts,</hi> His Majeſty hath received from the <hi>States,</hi> their <hi>breach of Treaties</hi> both in the <hi>Surinam,</hi> and <hi>Eaſt India</hi> buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and at laſt they came to that height of inſolence, as to deny the honour and right of the <hi>Flag,</hi> though an undoubted Jewel of this Crown, never to be parted with, and by them particularly owned, in the late Treaty of <hi>Breda,</hi> and never conteſted in any Age. And whileſt the King firſt long expected, and then ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demanded <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> they diſputed His title to it in all the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and made great offers to the <hi>French King,</hi> if he would ſtand by them againſt us. But the <hi>moſt Chriſtian King</hi> too well remembred what they did at <hi>Munſter,</hi> contrary to ſo many Treaties, and ſolemn Ingagements; and how dangerous a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour they were to all <hi>Crowned-heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40845:3"/>
The <hi>King</hi> and His <hi>Miniſters</hi> had here a hard time, and lay every day under new <hi>obloquies.</hi> Sometimes they were repreſented as <hi>ſelling</hi> all to <hi>France</hi> for money, to make this <hi>War; Portſmouth, Plimouth,</hi> and <hi>Hull,</hi> were to be given into the <hi>French</hi> hands for Caution. The next day news came, that <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> were agreed. Then the <hi>obloquy</hi> was turned from <hi>treachery</hi> to <hi>folly.</hi> The miniſters were now <hi>Fools,</hi> that ſome days before were <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Coffee-houſes</hi> were not to be blamed for their laſt apprehenſions; ſince if that <hi>Conjunction</hi> had taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then <hi>England</hi> had been in a far worſe caſe then now it is, and the War had been turned upon us. But <hi>both Kings,</hi> knowing their Intereſts, reſolved to Joyn againſt them; who were the Common Enemies to all <hi>Monarchies,</hi> and I may ſay, eſpecially to ours, their onely Competitor <hi>for trade,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> at <hi>Sea;</hi> and who onely ſtand in their way to an <hi>Univerſal Empire;</hi> as great as <hi>Rome.</hi> This the <hi>States</hi> underſtood ſo well, and had ſwallowed ſo deep, that under all their preſent diſtreſs, and danger, they are ſo intoxicated with that <hi>vaſt ambition,</hi> that they ſlight a <hi>Treaty,</hi> and refuſe a <hi>Ceſſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this you, and the whole Nation ſaw before the laſt <hi>War;</hi> but it could not then be ſo well <hi>timed,</hi> or our <hi>alliances</hi> ſo well made. But you judged aright, that at any rate, <hi>Delenda eſt Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thago,</hi> That <hi>Government</hi> was to be brought down. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>King</hi> may well ſay to you, <hi>'Tis your War.</hi> He took His <hi>meaſures</hi> from you, and they were <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>right</hi> ones: and He expects a ſuitable <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> to ſo neceſſary, and expenſive an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which He has hitherto maintained at His own change, and was unwilling either to <hi>trouble</hi> you, or <hi>burden</hi> the <hi>Country,</hi> until it came to an <hi>inevitable neceſſity.</hi> And His Majeſty commands me to tell you, that unleſs it be a <hi>certain Sum,</hi> and <hi>ſpeedily raiſed,</hi> it can never anſwer the Occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reputation</hi> is the great ſupport of War or Peace. This <hi>War</hi> had never begun, nor had the <hi>States</hi> ever ſlighted the <hi>King,</hi> or ever refuſed Him <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> neither had this <hi>War</hi> continued to this day, or ſubſiſted now, but that the <hi>States</hi> were deceived in their <hi>meaſures,</hi> and apprehended His <hi>Majeſty</hi> in that great want of money, that He muſt ſit down under any <hi>affronts,</hi> and was not able to begin, or carry on a <hi>War.</hi> Nay, at this day the <hi>States</hi> ſupport themſelves amongſt their people by this only <hi>falſhood,</hi> that they are aſſured of the <hi>temper</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that You will not ſupply the King in this War: And that if they can hold out till your meeting, they will have new life, and may take new <hi>meaſures.</hi> There are lately taken, two of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40845:4"/>
               <hi>Agents,</hi> with their Credentials and Inſtructions to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who are now in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſhall be proceeded againſt according to the Law of Nations. But the King is ſufficiently aſſured of <hi>His people:</hi> Knows you better: and can never doubt His <hi>Parliament.</hi> This had not been mentioned, but to ſhew you of what importance the <hi>frankneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonableneſs</hi> of this <hi>Supply</hi> is, as well as the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of it. Let me ſay, the King has brought the <hi>States</hi> to that condition, that your hearty conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at this time in <hi>ſupplying</hi> His Majeſty, will make them never more formidable to Kings, or dangerous to <hi>England.</hi> And if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this you ſuffer them to get up, let this be remembred, The <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> are <hi>Englands</hi> eternal Enemy, both by <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>inclination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, to the ſupply for the carrying on of the War, His Majeſty recommends to you the taking care of His <hi>Debts.</hi> What you gave the laſt Seſſion did not near anſwer <hi>your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</hi> Beſides, an other conſiderable Aid you deſigned His Majeſty, was <hi>unfortunately loſt in the birth;</hi> ſo that the King was forced for the carrying on of His affairs, much againſt His will, to put a ſtop to the payments out of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> He ſaw the <hi>preſſures</hi> upon himſelf, and <hi>growing inconveniencies</hi> to His people by great intereſt; and the difference through all His Buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Ready money,</hi> and <hi>Orders.</hi> This gave the King the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of that proceeding; to make uſe of His own Revenue, which hath been of ſo great effect in this War. But though he hath put a ſtop to the trade, and gain of the <hi>Bankers,</hi> yet he would be unwilling to ruine them, and oppreſs ſo many <hi>Families,</hi> as are concerned in thoſe debts; Beſides, it were too diſproportionable a burden upon many of His good Subjects. But neither the <hi>Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> nor they, have reaſon to complain, if you now take them into your care, and they have paid them, what was due to them, when the Stop was made, with Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> intereſt from that time. The King is very much concerned both in <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> to ſee this done. And yet he deſires you not to miſ-time it: but that it may have only the ſecond place, and that you will firſt ſettle, what you intend about the <hi>Supply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty has ſo fully vindicated His <hi>Declaration</hi> from that Calumny concerning the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that no reaſonable ſcruple can be made by any good man. He has ſufficiently juſtified it by the time it was publiſhed in, and the effects He hath had from it; and might have done it more, from the agreeableneſs of it, to His own natural diſpoſition, which no good <hi>Engliſh</hi> man can wiſh other then it is. He loves not bloud, or rigorous ſeverities; but where <hi>mild,</hi> or <hi>gentle</hi> wayes may be uſed by a <hi>wiſe Prince,</hi> He is certain to chooſe them. The <hi>Church of England,</hi> and all good <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have reaſon to rejoyce in ſuch a <hi>Head</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Defender.</hi> His Majeſty doth declare his care, and concerns for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40845:4"/>the <hi>Church,</hi> and will maintain them in all their <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> equal, if not beyond any of His Predeceſſors: He was born, and bred up in it: It was that His Father died for: We all know how great temptations and offers He reſiſted abroad, when He was in His loweſt condition: And He thinks it the honour of His reign, that He hath been the <hi>Reſtorer</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> 'Tis that He will ever maintain, and hopes to leave to poſterity, in greater <hi>luſtre,</hi> and upon ſurer <hi>grounds,</hi> then our anceſtors ever ſaw it. But His Majeſty is not convinced, that <hi>violent ways</hi> are the intereſt of <hi>Religion</hi> or the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one thing more, that I am commanded to ſpeak to you of, Which is the <hi>jealouſie,</hi> that hath been fooliſhly ſpread abroad, of the forces the King hath raiſed in this War. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King hath <hi>opened himſelf freely</hi> to you, and confeſſed the fault on the other hand. For if this laſt Summer had not proved a <hi>miracle</hi> of <hi>ſtorms,</hi> and <hi>tempeſts,</hi> ſuch as ſecured their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Fleer, and protected their Sea-coſt from a diſcent, nothing but the true reaſon (want of Money) could have juſtified the defect in the number of our forces. 'Tis that His Majeſty is providing for againſt the next Spring, having given out <hi>Orders</hi> for the raiſing of ſeven or eight Regiments more of Foot, under the Command of Perſons of the greateſt <hi>Fortunes</hi> and <hi>Quality.</hi> And I am earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to recommend to you, that in your Supplies, you will take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your conſideration this neceſſary <hi>addition</hi> of <hi>charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after His Majeſties <hi>concluſion</hi> of His Speech, let me <hi>conclude,</hi> nay, let us all conclude, with bleſſing <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> Let us bleſs <hi>God,</hi> that he hath given us ſuch a <hi>King</hi> to be the <hi>repairer</hi> of our <hi>breaches</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and the <hi>reſtorer of our paths to dwell in:</hi> That in the midſt of War and Miſery, which rages in our neighbour Countries, our <hi>garners are full,</hi> and <hi>there is no compleaning in our ſtreets:</hi> And a man can hardly <hi>know</hi> that there is a War. Let us bleſs <hi>God,</hi> that hath given this King ſignally the hearts of His <hi>people,</hi> and moſt particularly of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> who in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and loyalty to their Prince, have exceeded <hi>all</hi> their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors. A <hi>Parliament</hi> with whom the King hath many years lived with all the <hi>Careſſes</hi> of a happy Mariage. Has the King had a <hi>concern?</hi> You have wedded it. Has His Majeſty wanted <hi>Supplies?</hi> You have readily, cheerfully, and fully provided for them. You have relied upon the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of His Majeſty in all His affairs: ſo that you have never attempted to exceed <hi>your bounds,</hi> or to <hi>impoſe</hi> upon Him: whileſt the King on the other hand, hath made Your Counſels the foundations of all His proceedings; and hath been ſo tender of you; that He hath upon His own <hi>revenue</hi> and <hi>credit</hi> endeavoured to ſupport even <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Wars,</hi> that he might be leaſt uneaſie to you, or burdenſom
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40845:5"/>to His people. And let me ſay, that though this <hi>Mariage</hi> be according to <hi>Moſes's Law,</hi> where the husband can give a <hi>Bill of divorce,</hi> put her away, and take <hi>another:</hi> Yet I can aſſure you, it is as impoſſible for the King to part with <hi>this Parliament,</hi> as it is for <hi>you</hi> to depart from that <hi>loyalty, affection,</hi> and <hi>dutiful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,</hi> you have hitherto ſhewed towards Him.</p>
            <p>Let us bleſs the <hi>King</hi> for taking away all our <hi>fears,</hi> and leaving no room for <hi>jealouſies:</hi> For thoſe <hi>aſſurances,</hi> and <hi>promiſes</hi> He hath made us. Let us bleſs <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> that our <hi>Religion</hi> is ſafe: That the <hi>Church of England</hi> is the care of our Prince: That <hi>Parliaments</hi> are ſafe: That our <hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> are ſafe. What more hath a good <hi>Engliſh</hi> man to ask, but that <hi>this King</hi> may long reign, and that this Triple-alliance, of <hi>King, Parliament,</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> may never be diſſolved?</p>

            <p>SInce it is Your Gracious Pleaſure not to accept of my humble Excuſe, but by Your Royal Approbation to fix me under this Great, though Honourable Weight, and to think me fit to be inveſted with a Truſt of ſo high a nature as this is:</p>
            <p>I take it in the firſt place to be incumbent upon me, that I render Your Majeſty all poſſible thanks, which I now humbly do with a heart full of all Duty, and affected with a deeper ſenſe of Gratitude then I can find words to expreſs.</p>
            <p>Next, from Your Royal Determination in this Affair, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by You have imprinted a new Character upon me, I take courage againſt my own diffidence, and chearfully bend my ſelf with ſuch ſtrength and abilities as God ſhall give, to the Service ſo graciouſly deſigned me; no way doubting, that Your Majeſty will pleaſe to pardon my Frailties, to accept of my faithful Endeavous, and always to look favourably on the Work of Your own hands.</p>
            <p>And now Sir, my firſt Entrance upon this Service, obliges me to make a few neceſſary, but humble Petitions on the behalf of Your moſt Loyal and Dutiful Houſe of Commons;
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That for our better Attendance on the Publick Service, we and our Servants may be free in our Perſons and Eſtates from Arreſts and other Diſturbances.</hi>
